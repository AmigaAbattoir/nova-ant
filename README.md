# Ant Extension for Panic's Nova

Extension for running [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) builds from a sidebar in [Panic's Nova](https://nova.app/)

Includes Apache Ant 1.10.14.

# Notes

Currently, very limited functionality. Basically finds all targets. If used to using something like Eclipse, it does not show all elements like `properties`,`echo`, etc. Right now, only `additional` `file`.
