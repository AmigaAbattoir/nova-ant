**Ant** provides sidebar integration with **Apache Ant**, allowing you to click and launch build tasks.

## Requirements

Ant requires some additional tools to be installed on your Mac:

- Java 8 or newer

Make sure that `JAVA_HOME` has been set, and points to a JDK in you system. Otherwise, you may get errors if the build is using `javac`.

Included in the extensions is Apache Ant 1.10.14.

## Usage

To display the Ant sidebar:

- Click on the "All Sidebars" button.
- Select **Ant** or drag to a sidebar area

### Configuration

In the future, to configure global preferences, open **Extensions → Extension Library...** then select Ant's **Preferences** tab.

You can also configure preferences on a per-project basis in **Project → Project Settings...**
