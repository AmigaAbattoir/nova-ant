<!--
ðŸ‘‹ Hello! As Nova users browse the extensions library, a good README can help them understand what your extension does, how it works, and what setup or configuration it may require.

Not every extension will need every item described below. Use your best judgement when deciding which parts to keep to provide the best experience for your new users.

ðŸ’¡ Quick Tip!Â As you edit this README template, you can preview your changes by selecting **Extensions â†’ Activate Project as Extension**, opening the Extension Library, and selecting "Ant" in the sidebar.

Let's get started!

<!--
ðŸŽˆ Include a brief description of the features your extension provides. For example:
-->

**Ant** provides sidebar integration with **A Helpful Tool**, including the most important feature, something that's really helpful, and _a little-known secret!_

<!--
ðŸŽˆ It can also be helpful to include a screenshot or GIF showing your extension in action:

## Requirements

<!--
ðŸŽˆ If your extension depends on external processes or tools that users will need to have, it's helpful to list those and provide links to their installers:
-->

Ant requires some additional tools to be installed on your Mac:

- Java 8 or newer

## Usage

<!--
ðŸŽˆ If your extension provides features that are invoked manually, consider describing those options for users:
-->

To run Ant:

- Select the **Editor â†’ Ant** menu item; or
- Open the command palette and type `Ant`

<!--
ðŸŽˆ Alternatively, if your extension runs automatically (as in the case of a validator), consider showing users what they can expect to see.
-->

### Configuration

<!--
ðŸŽˆ If your extension offers global- or workspace-scoped preferences, consider pointing users toward those settings. For example:
-->

To configure global preferences, open **Extensions â†’ Extension Library...** then select Ant's **Preferences** tab.

You can also configure preferences on a per-project basis in **Project â†’ Project Settings...**
